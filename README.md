# 20w14i_dimension_hopper
Datapack for a dimension hopping gamemode using the 2020 april fools update

Gamemode gives you 5 minutes in a set of 5 dimensions, then 10 mins in a small flatgrass overworld area.
Gives a wood pickaxe to start and a stone pickaxe after dimension hopping 
"Permadeath" inventory and overworld area wiped on death.
Aim is to beat the enderdragon (forcably in the end to prevent killing it in some random other dimension?)
